# Pizza-Place-Sales
In this project I used the data provided at https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground which includes information about a year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

The data was cleaned, transformed and analyzed with DAX and finally visualized using Power BI.
